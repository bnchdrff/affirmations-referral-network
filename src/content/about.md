This Health & Wellness Network is a project of Affirmations - Metro Detroit’s LGBT community center for lesbian, gay, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) people and their allies.  Affirmations' Health & Wellness program area works to address LGBT health inequities by improving the health and well-being of LGBT individuals and communities through professional training and development, LGBT-affirming mental health services, community education, coalition building, and connecting LGBT people to health resources.

On this site you will find a searchable database of healthcare providers in southeastern Michigan who have signed our Community Standards of Practice listed below. If you are healthcare provider who is interested in joining this Health & Wellness Network, please contact us for more information. 

Health care providers that appear on our referral list have agreed to abide by our Community Standards of Practice - beyond this, Affirmations disclaims any affiliation or association with these service providers and further disclaims any liability for the actions, inactions or quality of care provided by these individuals or organizations.

# Community Standards of Practice

* As a health care provider, I will uphold the ethical rights of all people regardless of race, national origin, religion, gender identity, disability or sexual orientation. I understand the following guidelines and agree to adhere to them.

* As a health care provider, I will establish, promote and effectively communicate an inclusive, non-discriminatory environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients.

* I will work towards ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients of all ages are subject to the same terms and conditions as heterosexuals.

* I will assure that comprehensive policies are implemented to prohibit discrimination in the delivery of services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients and their families. For the purpose of these standards the terms "family” and "families” shall be broadly construed, and shall include but not be limited to relatives by blood, adoption, marriage or declaration of domestic partnership.

* I will also ensure that this office has comprehensive and easily accessible procedures in place for patients to file and resolve complaints alleging violations of these policies.

* Our office will develop and implement intake and assessment procedures to ensure that they meet the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients of all ages and their families, reviewing existing procedures where necessary.

* The provider (s) and office staff will have a basic familiarity with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues as they pertain to services provided.

* All direct care staff will include, when appropriate, the domestic partners and/or other chosen family members of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients as they would include spouses and families of heterosexual patients in discussing diagnoses and treatment plans.

* All case management and treatment plans will include and address sexual orientation and gender identity where it is a necessary and appropriate issue in patient care.

* The provider(s) and the office staff will ensure the confidentiality of patient data, including information about sexual orientation and gender identity issues. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients shall be informed about data collection that includes references to sexual orientation and/or gender identity, including in what circumstances such information may be disclosed, whether it will be disclosed as aggregate or individual information, whether personal identifiers may be disclosed, and how and by whom such information may be used.

* The provider’s office will include lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their families in outreach and health promotion efforts.

* If the provider is connected to hospitals where they would send lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients, the hospital board of directors and other institutional bodies shall be encouraged to have representation from these communities.

# Providers may be removed from Affirmations’ Health & Wellness Network for the following reasons:

* Contact information for a provider is no longer accurate and has not been updated.
* Three or more general complaints have been received by Affirmations regarding services rendered, and these issues have not been resolved in an adequate manner.
* Affirmations ultimately reserves the right to remove any agency or clinic from the list at any time.
